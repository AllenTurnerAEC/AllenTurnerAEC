# Hi, I'm Allen Turner 

## Building DatumOS @ StudioDatum

After 27 years in AEC technology, I'm finally building the solution I wished existed.

**What we're solving:** The 18-minute document search. The institutional knowledge that walks out the door. The operational chaos that costs AEC firms billions annually.

**What I'm working on:**
- DatumOS - AI-powered operational intelligence for A&E firms
- Agent harnesses for AEC workflows
- Knowledge graphs for document relationships
- Sub-second semantic search across connected systems

**Tech Stack:**
`Claude Agent SDK` `Vercel AI SDK` `Context Graphs` `Next.js` `TypeScript` `PostgreSQL`
